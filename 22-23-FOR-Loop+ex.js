        // For Loop 

// print 0 to 9

for(let i = 0; i<=10;i++){
    console.log(i)
}  
// if the let is used inside the loop, then it is not be able to print seperatly, because it was in the for, but var can be print seperately,and in for loop, in some cases, variable can also declare outside the loop!



            // For loop example

let total = 0;
let num = 10;

for(let i = 0; i<=num; i++){
    total = total + i;
}console.log(total)
